# Cisco NSO for SPAUTO
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco NSO RESTCONF API.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There are two environments included with the collection:
  * `reservable_dev`: Contains host/credential information for the Cisco DevNet
    reservable NSO instance, which require a DevNet account and
    valid reservation to utilize. This connects to the DevBox and only works
    if you've manually installed NSO following the various Learning Labs.
  * `reservable_prod`: Contains host/credential information for the Cisco DevNet
    reservable NSO instance, which require a DevNet account and
    valid reservation to utilize. This works out of the box and allows you
    to interact with NSO immediately.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
