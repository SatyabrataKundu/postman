# Cisco Stealthwatch for SAUTO
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco Stealthwatch
Enterprise and Cloud REST APIs.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection.

  * `reservable`: Contains SMC host, username, and password information for
    the Stealthwatch Enterprise DevNet sandbox, which requires a DevNet account
    and valid reservation to utilize. Placeholders for Stealthwatch Cloud are
    also included, but there is no DevNet sandbox to date, so you must supply
    your personal credentials.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
