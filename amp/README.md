# Cisco AMP for SAUTO
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco AMP REST API.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `template`: Contains placeholders for the `client_id` and `api_key`
    variables. These are used as the HTTP basic auth username and password,
    respectively, within the Postman collection. At the time of this
    writing, there is no publicly accessible AMP cloud account, so you
    must populate this environment with your personal credentials.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
