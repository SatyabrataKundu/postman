# Cisco Webex
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco Webex REST API. This includes
Webex Teams and Webex Meetings.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `template`: Contains placeholders for the `api_key`
    variables. This is required to authenticate and authorize to the API.
    Note that if your API key ends with the word `consumer`, you will not
    be able to access the "Meetings" features. Log in here to get an API key:
    `https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/getting-started`

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
