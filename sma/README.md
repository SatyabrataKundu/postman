# Cisco Security Management Appliance (SMA) for SAUTO
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco SMA REST API. SMA
is a front-end management system for the Cisco Email Security
Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `reservable`: Contains host/credential information for the Cisco dCloud
    reservable "Security Everywhere" demo, which requires a dCloud account
    and valid reservation to utilize. Cisco DevNet does not have an SMA
    sandbox at this time, but the dCloud SMA comes with the REST API
    already enabled and operational.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
