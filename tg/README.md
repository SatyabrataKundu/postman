# Cisco ThreatGrid for SAUTO
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco ThreatGrid REST API.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `template`: Contains a placeholder for the `api_key` variable.
    This is included as the `api_key` query parameter for authentication
    for all requests within the Postman collection. At the time of this
    writing, there is no publicly accessible ThreatGrid cloud account,
    so you must populate this environment with your personal credentials.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
