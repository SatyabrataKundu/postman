# Cisco Nexus NX-API and RESTCONF for DEVASC and DCAUTO
Postman collection to interact with the various Cisco Nexus HTTP-based APIs.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There are two environments included with the collection:
  * `always_on`: Contains host/credential information for the Cisco DevNet
    "Always On" Open NX-OS Nexus 9kv device, which is publicly available to all.
  * `reservable`: Contains host/credential information for the Cisco DevNet
    reservable NX-OS Nexus 9kv device, which requires a DevNet account and
    valid reservation to utilize.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
